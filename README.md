# data-analytics-portfolio

This repo holds my projects. They exist to show my work quality and how I think through problems.

## Projects in this portfolio

### Ecommerce Data Cleaning (Python)
- Takes raw messy ecommerce events.
- Cleans and standardizes the data so it is usable for analysis.
- Fixes missing values, broken timestamps, and inconsistent product information.
- Produces clean, analysis-ready CSV files.

### Pricing and Promotion Analysis (SQL)
- Loads and prepares a full ecommerce database.
- Builds tables that show real pricing behavior, discount impact, and promo effectiveness.
- Helps answer business questions like:
  - Do discounts increase or destroy margin
  - Which products actually drive revenue
  - How customer orders change with free shipping or price cuts
