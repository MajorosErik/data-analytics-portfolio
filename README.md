# data-analytics-portfolio

This repo holds my projects. They exist to show my work quality and how I think through problems.

## Projects in this portfolio

### Ecommerce Data Cleaning
- Takes multi-million row count messy ecommerce events.
- Cleans and standardizes the data so it is usable for analysis.
- Fixes missing values, broken timestamps, and inconsistent product information.
- Produces clean, analysis-ready CSV files.

### Pricing and Promotion Analysis
- Loads and prepares a full ecommerce database.
- Builds tables that show real pricing behavior, discount impact, and promo effectiveness.
- Helps answer business questions like:
  - Do discounts increase or destroy margin
  - Which products actually drive revenue
  - How customer orders change with free shipping or price cuts

### Customer Value and Churn
- Takes the ecommerce transactions we cleaned at line and order level.
- Rolls them up into one row per customer with lifetime revenue, order counts, and recency features.
- Defines a clear churn rule and calculates a simple, transparent CLTV metric with Low, Medium, High value segments.
- Exports a 'ltv_results' table that is ready for dashboards, retention analysis, and later CLV modeling work.
